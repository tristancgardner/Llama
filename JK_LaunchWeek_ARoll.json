                "Transcription": "Oh my god. Hey, I'm Jim Kitchen, and my nuts are frozen. Great. Awesome. We got it. Okay. I'm gonna have to keep this on. All right, Jim, tell us what you did yesterday. Tell us, first of all, what day it is today, including the day and the launch day. And then we'll begin with your recap of what you did yesterday. It's L-2. It's getting real. So this is the schedule for today. And then I'll tell you about what we did yesterday. We got breakfast. Filming the triad, the highlight of my day. It's freezing out here by the airstream, but we're good. Got some shaking off the fatigue because it's been a couple of sleepless nights powering through that. Got some astronaut food to wake me up. That's breakfast. And training begins at eight. basically goes from 8 to 5. And then the Carolina game. Yeah. Triad's really important, but the Carolina game is big. So that's 0 minus 2. Yesterday was the first day of training. So they introduced us to the capsule and they told us, they took us through every scenario. Showed us really from the beginning, showed us from the beginning of launch what the capsule is gonna do. So it rests on the rocket and then it, we have maximum dynamic pressure And then the capsule separates from the launch vehicle. And then we basically float in space for about three and a half minutes. And then we basically go down and we hit 5Gs as we re-enter the atmosphere. And then we float down. The sounds of all of that are intense. So you're sitting on the launch pad and you hear all of these gases. So we're inside this simulated capsule, same size, and you hear all these sounds and they're absolutely deafening. So you have ear buds in there, custom ear buds, to dampen the noise. And when you take off, the inside of the capsule lights orange to simulate the flames coming out of the bottom of the rocket. So they're like, OK, that's fine. That's normal. And then they, when the rocket and the capsule separate, it's just deafening. And what's sobering is there's, for all of this to go perfectly, So many things just have to work correctly. So, you know, you hear about training and you're like, oh, you know, okay, you got to learn how to put my seatbelt on. No, it's being aware of all of the things that could go wrong. And so when I said this morning that it's real, it's because of yesterday. Because, you know, maybe all of these things go right, maybe they don't, and you got to kind of be ready for it. And it's real. So they've only done 20 of these launches. This will be the 20th launch. And, you know, it's very sobering. So today we do it again and again and again and again. We will probably do somewhere between 10 to 15 simulated launches so that on launch day we know everything, what to expect. We know All of the noises, we know how to put our, it's a five point seatbelt. So you got to learn how to get it on. And then when you get into zero gravity, up at around 325,000 feet, which is 10 times as high as we're an airplane flies. You got to be able to get back in to that seat belt in zero g. So you got to learn how to do that. And it's not as easy as just like snap. There's you know. pulling and prodding and getting, you know, sometimes it's wrong. And anyway, you gotta learn how to do all that. And there's a quiz at the end of the day. So you gotta, you gotta, I've been taking copious notes. So it's mentally taxing, but it's so much fun. So if I'm coming off as like, oh, this is a lot and woe is me. Oh my God. This is so much fun. Okay. I'm tired. You can probably see it in my eyes this morning. Um, but oh man, this is, this is the dream of a lifetime. So. That's so pretty out there. I know it's too bad, but we're not Did they tell me five minutes? Did they tell you five minutes? Oh, was I needed? Okay. I just want to ask him about the real, when did you realize yesterday in the training it was real? Yeah, and then a little bit more about like expectations for today. Yeah, those two things. Yeah, but remind me so. All right, Jim, you talked about it getting real after yesterday, but what was the moment during yesterday when you really realized it? What was the first time you were like, oh wow, this isn't a joke, this isn't an easy little training. I think it was just understanding that, well, first of all, I was getting in the capsule for the first time. I was like, oh, this is so much fun. Look, there's my seat. And then being strapped in and hearing the noises, and combined with the videos that we saw, and hearing all of the, contingencies of, all right, if this doesn't work, then the rocket booster or the capsule will do this. And like one of the things is if there's a multiple thing, multiplicity of things that can go wrong, and if they do, you better be strapped in and your head better be against the headrest because this capsule can literally eject from the rocket booster and go 23 g's like independently so it has a rocket engine in the middle of the capsule and it can go off at any second and if you're standing or just goofing around and your head's like over here you may not, you know, you won't survive that. So, you know, watching that, getting your seat belt adjusted properly, you know, you sit in an airplane, it's like, seat belt, ah, you know, this is, it's for real, it's legit, because we're going to be going 2,300 miles an hour. Today is going through all of the launch sequence from A to Z. multiple times so that on launch day, it's routine. It's like, I know what that noise is. I know what I'm doing. I know what my launch plan is. You know, what I'm going to be doing. My seatbelt is configured properly. A big thing today is coming up with what's called a zero G plan. what the crew is going to do, kind of combined, and what I'm going to do in my three and a half minutes of zero-g. "

Just ask, just tell him. Wait, is it... Oh, is it a door? It's a maintenance door. Yeah. All right, let's just do it again. Yeah. All right. You just go through. Yesterday was a full, full day. It was like the biggest day of training. And it was mentally exhausting and just physically demanding, because we went through so many different scenarios. And I got to just stop and tell you, there's a lot of stuff that has to happen right in order for a rocket to be launched in the air up to space. And you kind of just see it, and you think, Oh, that was easy, but it's not. There's literally like 600 automated buttons, which are sequences that have to go right. And if they, if they don't go right, that means it's off nominal. Nominal is good. Normal. There's nothing normal about a space trip. So that's why they call it nominal. An off nominal means one of those 600 things is somehow wrong. And so you have to prepare for the nominal things like getting into your seat. Oh, well, sounds easy in a car, but in a capsule that's up in space, those kind of things are hard. So you go through all of those scenarios And you got to drill it over and over and over again. And I'm talking like 25 times where you go through the sequences of events, all the safety protocol, all of that. And man, it's just at the end of the day, I was just wiped out. But oh my God, so much fun. So it's not like, oh, it was me. I had to do space training for a day. But it's a lot of stuff. What was your favorite part? I think it was... Say my favorite part. My favorite part was when you spend time with five other people and you're all doing these things and you're doing them wrong at first and then you're doing it right. I think spending time with people, getting to know the other crewmates was the best part. The funny thing was, Pete Davidson was going to go on this trip, and he ended up not going. And Gary Lai, who was the architect, the designer of the rocket that we're flying in, took his place. And it's, wow, there was like, oh, Pete's not going. That would have been really cool. Gary couldn't have been any better. Gary is the best. And from the minute he walked in the room, we all had a zillion questions. So I'm probably the most, I'm the best educated, not me, but our crew is probably the best educated that will ever be because we had the freaking chief architect of the rocket on board and he answered every question. He's, he's been a trooper. So, um, second other, other favorite things is putting together what's called a zero G plan. So you get up in space and you got four minutes, what are you going to do? Got to have a plan. Otherwise you're just, you know, kind of winging it. So I've got my plan of stuff that I'm going to do. And you guys will see that. You don't want to tell us right now? Let me give you some broad strokes that I am going to do a handstand, upside down handstand. I am going to fly my passport. There will be a couple of flags. There will be a simulated stamp of a passport by one of the other crew members and some other shenanigans. and some quiet time. I will have a quiet, reflective time. Um, thanking our wonderful God, uh, the Holy Spirit that has just infused my body and it just, man, has given me so much power to do the things that I do. Can't take that for granted. And, uh, just giving some thanks, man. And, uh, recognizing the people of the Ukraine who are really suffering under a brutal, uh, occupation and war, being mindful of that. I'm going to space. They're dealing with that. And so my heart and soul and mind and strength and well wishes are with them. And I'll tell you about that postcard I wrote to Mr. Putin at maybe here in a minute. Okay. And tell us what you did today. And then you can just give me a brief thoughts about today. And I want to kind of tell me about that. Tell me about these postcards that you wrote. Tell me about these postcards you wrote, Jim. I'm so glad you asked about these postcards, because I wrote three of them. And one of them said this really cool saying when I was learning about the first airline passenger. In 1914, some guy paid a bunch of money to fly over the Tampa Bay. So Tampa to St. Pete, first flight, 1914. I read about that before this launch, because the two are very similar. And what the quote was for that flight was, what was impossible yesterday is the ordinary today and tomorrow heralds the unbelievable. And here we are at the edge of the unbelievable. So that was postcard number one that said at the bottom, live the unbelievable. So the message to everyone that live your life unbelievably. Number two is specifically addressed to the students at the University of North Carolina. That said, thank you for the privilege of being able to teach you. Keep that anything is possible. Push boundaries. and keep the dream alive. Because this dream of going to space has been alive for 50 years. So maybe your journey isn't one of... So those are the three things that I wrote. And thanks for the opportunity to teach. And you guys are, you know, some of my former triad is some of my former students. So, man, it's been a privilege. So keep that dream alive. So proud of you guys. And then the last one was to Mr. Putin. And I think I blew everyone's head exploded when I showed this one. But it's basically said, some form of, I've traveled the world and people are good. Everyone's good. And, uh, I believe in you and the best of you. Please stop this war. And then I shot my name. So, um, I'm not sure if that one's going to make the final cut. I'm not sure that that one's gonna, but I'm, I'm, I'm going to send it to the Kremlin. Um, PO box one Kremlin, Moscow, Russia, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero. So those are my three postcards. I love the postcards. Can you give us just something brief to contextualize what the postcards are, why you wrote them? The postcards are supposed to be messages to people that would inspire future generations. Did Blue Origin give them to you? They did. OK. Just say, so Blue Origin had us do this. So Blue Origin had us fill out these postcards that were designed to inspire the next generation of space travelers. So. Good. Great. That's all we needed. Nice coming in with you, Roald. Perfect. Yeah, good. What the hell does Putin have to do with that? and others. No, it'll make sense now. So, um, tell us about your training today and, but just be brief. And I want to, I want to ask you more. Am I going on too long? No, no, you're good. Cause I want to get to a different question. All right. Um, so my training today was basically a summary of what we did yesterday and more intense. We just had to do it faster. And we had a written and a, uh, We had an exam to make sure that we knew how to do everything. So we had five simulations with off-nominal and nominal events and nominal launches, and we all passed. Ready to go. Amazing. You're a little bit like, kind of like halfway, kind of like towards the end of the trip now in terms of your training. How are you feeling now versus the beginning? Had a lot more nerves at the beginning. Now I'm ready to go. I'm a little anxious right now because all of my a lot of my friends and family are in El Paso, which is a couple hours away. They are flying in today and we just got some got some news. So. The flight was scrubbed. which means delayed until basically for two days, until Thursday. So today's a Tuesday, or no, today's a Monday, we're supposed to launch tomorrow, and now it's going off Thursday. Why the delay? Because of high winds. Tomorrow, if we were sitting here, there would be a sandstorm out. You would not even be able to see that little center area over there, that cool-ass river. Man, I said, why don't you charge me a little more and just let me take that thing home? Maybe pull my Airstream out along with it. I'll just drive home. That thing's pretty sweet. Okay, so it's Thursday now. You already said you're ready to go. Now you get a couple extra days to be ready to go. What do you think you're going to be feeling by then? I'm so ready. I'm ready. I was ready to go tomorrow. A couple more days. We've got to retrain. For some reason there's a new sequence of events and they won't tell me what it is. But something's going down. But not in a bad way. I just think that something different's happening. So we've got to do a little bit more training on Wednesday. But I'm ready to go. OK, great. We've gotten most of what we need. Tell me a little bit about the ring you're wearing. This is a diagnostic ring. It's basically called a hospital on your finger. reads your pulse rate, so your heart rate, and also does your blood pressure. So if you touch it like this, it does your blood pressure. It has your heart rate variability, your pulse ox, like the amount of oxygen in your bloodstream. And what's really cool is in about like six months, it'll be able to read your blood glucose level. So for diabetics, I'm not diabetic, but for diabetics, you'll know how much, you know, you won't have to do a finger prick or, you know, blood stick, any of that. Um, it's an amazing ring and we're going to take this diagnostic. So my resting pulse is roughly 52, 50, somewhere between 50 and 52. Cause you're a runner. I'm a runner. And, um, we're going to see what it is at launch. which will be like 180. And then we're going to measure what's called AWE. So everyone knows the term AWESOME. That means that you're filled with inspiration. Don't know exactly what AWE is other than, you know, we all use that term. AWESOME. And I think it's just seeing the Earth. I don't know. I don't want to overthink it. I just want to see. So I'm working with some students at UNC Astronomy. And we're going to do some, we've done some pre-questions and we're going to do some post-questions and see if Professor Kitchen felt awe when he was in space. Matching up with bio data, pulse rate, oxygen levels, and see if the two converge. Jim, UNC basketball has had one of the greatest tournament runs in Hubert Davis's first year of coaching and is set to face Duke in Coach K's last year ever in one of the greatest college basketball matchups in NCAA history in the Final Four. That on the same week of you going to space that's a lot of different kind of emotions going around, you know? You think there's some type of spiritual or philosophical alignment? Yeah, you see my eyes turn up. It's just too much. It really is too much. Not only is it the highlight of Coach Davis's one-year career, you know, professional career, all of a head coach of one season, Carolina has never played Duke ever in the NCAA tournament. This is a game that should never happen. But it's so, and I don't know what the outcome's gonna be. But a fitting end to that game would be North Carolina whipping Duke's ass, pardon my French, Coach K's last game and him getting dogged by a first-year coach with a bunch of scrubs who underperformed all season, and Coach K being outworked and out-hustled by a young go-get-'em coach and a team fired up. And if that game is close at the end, imagine how tight Duke is going to be. So this has got to be this. This just has to end that way. Is it correlated to me going to space? I don't know. I have been texting Armando during the whole, you know, NCAA run of. Keeping the faith, man, this is this somebody's got to win. Push the boundaries. Come on. Anything is possible. And if that's a message, if that's a message for anyone to hear, it's Armando to share with that team. So I have nothing to do with that team winning. But I think they're fired up. And I don't know what's going to happen. If any Duke fans see this, I'm a good target. I'm just messing with y'all. But that would be a fitting end. And how do you feel about all of this happening while you're in space? Is it exciting? This is so exciting that I wouldn't normally go to the national championship game. Carolina's playing Duke. But that's going to happen. This launch, good Lord willing, will happen on Thursday. And there's no way my head and my brain could ever tolerate going to a UNC playing Duke and be like, you know, and watching the game after this experience. So I'm just going to let it unfold. Yeah. All right. That's good, Jim. Thanks so much. We're going to film a couple of Instagram things. And feel free to leave that whole section out. Yeah. Well, we're going to come through. Yeah. OK. Pick out stuff. Yeah. Good job. I thought it was fine. Yeah. One of the best people in school. Dr. Bull. All right, we're going to keep that on you, actually, because we need that fur out here. Now, these, we're going to go with a tripod. You're not going to be moving. And it's extra important, since we can't put that lab outside because of the wind, that you just stay very still. So just like you're giving a press conference or something. Do you want this on your shirt? Let me take it off for you. I don't even know what I'm doing. Let's take it off. Oh, that's cool. Thanks, man. Oh, by the way, you know what I should have told you guys? I'm absolutely wearing a diaper tomorrow. Oh, that is funny. I am, just for the full experience. They said, hey, you can wear a diaper. And the guy was in there, did a shuttle launch. He did a shuttle walk, like walk in space. And he goes, yeah, you should wear a diaper. I was like, why? He goes, just, have you ever worn a diaper before? I said, no. He said, you should. Man, it's the full space experience. Man, astronauts wear diapers. Yeah, they have to. Right? Oh, you hit that. They gotta go. They gotta go. Yeah, man. And I bought them. That'll be the only chance I get until another 10 years. I hope it's on 10 years. So the content we're going to get, we're going to film three videos. The first one, we're just going to do a quick announcement that the flight's been moved. And I'll get that done and sorted and sent as soon as possible. We're just going to do them in just different locations, so it switches up a bit. And then the other ones we'll do is the three that we have planned. So one's about space training. I'll do this one here. You tell me where. You want me to do one on that bike? I'm going to have you stand up. I can do it on that bike. Today, we're here in my Rivian. Hey, why not? You're already here. I'm pretty sure Baszler's just coming on Thursday. He is. Was he not going to come if it was tomorrow? He's giving a speech tonight. For? I don't know, something. Something? Something, something, something. They're just tossing you around all day long. Seems like their plans just keep changing too. Their plans just keep changing too. Okay, so I wrote just a quick something. You can change it as you want and you can add just to the end. But just in case you want something. Tuesday's launch. If you want something on the teleprompter, or you can just talk straight to the camera. You all right? OK, that's good. That's good? Yeah, you can add something to the end if you want. I mean, it's just going to be something real quick. Short, easy stuff. I think I should say why. Yeah, I think so too. And if you could turn around and point again. Never mind. Don't turn around, but just be like in behind me. Let's see if we can find a windsock. There may be a windsock. Windsock's over there to the left on the building. On the bike? We've got more if you want to do one on the bike. You're going to stand back, like not in the shade. So these guys are up there with this other group? Yeah. They're like, for the Hagels? Yeah. They're like, we're the first couple that's ever done this. Exactly. Press release. No, you're only squinting there. I can't do it in the shade without the light. Here, I'm fine. I won't squint. Just point them the other way. Did you guys get that picture? What picture? Your picture of Triad. I don't know if this motel even has a printer, but we'll go to the Holiday Inn down the road. Yeah, yeah, I'll put them in my pocket I'm gonna, um, hold on one second. I've been stuck in a stick. Shut up over there, Mikey. No, no, go get the car. You intend to get rid of that, right? You're getting rid of that car? Yeah. So, um, yeah, shut up, Mikey. So, um, so, um, by the way, does that have Pete Davidson's name on it or not? What? No. Oh, fuck. I want one of those. I want one of the, uh, I want a, you know what time it'd be worth having Pete Davidson? How about, um, So, I'm getting some pile of shit, all these stickers that I couldn't fit in my bag. I'm bringing them on my body and they don't know. And then I'm like, I've got 194 flag. It's a three by two, tomorrow morning. And they were kicking me around today like, we can't tell you, except we're gonna go or not. I'm like, fuck you, you're causing me stress. I'm gonna put it right here, or right back here. And then I walk out, and I've not practiced this at all, and I told them I'm doing this. And the capsule opens, and they're like, hey, everybody walk out. The capsule's landed. The press is there. They're live feed. And they're playing it like that. Oh, we're the first couple. And they're going to be like, we're the first. And then they're going to kiss. People are going to be like, oh, that's the story. Fuck it. I'm coming out. So I'm coming out. I'm going to be like this. And also, in my hand, I'm going to unfurl the 194 flag. And I've already met the photographer. And I'm going to be like, totally. Yeah. That's awesome. People are going to be, what's 194? They're going to be like, oh, there's Jim with his 194 flag. That's the guy that went to space. Hell yeah. Isn't that good? That's amazing. And on the way in and the way out, I've got my passport here. This is my pose. in front of the capsule just before you go in, so it could be before that. That's perfect, yeah. So you were the first married couple? The first person around the globe anyways. I mean, that's going to go in history books. It's hard to understand how crazy that really is. You let me know when you're done. I couldn't stop that story, Mikey. Oh, you know what I heard today? You remember they said, oh, there's like a 30-second, we have a 30-second window to talk about a capsule? Yeah. It's like five minutes now. Yeah. Was it always five minutes? No, it wasn't. They did say, they said 30 seconds at the very first talk. Yeah. Now it's two minutes. No, because, no, they said today was five minutes. If it changed three more times, it would surprise me. I've got to re-put this mic back on. You just felt it. You're talking about after you guys like land and everything for the booster, right? That's what you're saying? Yeah. Do I need to go inside? I need to put more tape on this. Hold that. These are so chapped. I need to go get some chapstick in the bathroom in there. I need to go get some. Do you want me to put a black shirt on myself? I've got one. Let's do this one with white. Wait, guys. Tell them what we did yesterday. Oh, yeah. Did you go to Lake Springs? We went to White Sands pretty much right after. How was it? It was beautiful. It was actually worth it. It was way worth it. Yeah, it was worth it. That was sick. How far is that? That's the missile test. It is, it is. Isn't that pretty? Wow. Totally white. Wow. No wonder they call it white sand. Oh yeah. there. Watched the game. You watched it at El Paso? Nice. And then we went to a card house in El Paso and me and Barker played poker for three hours. To where? What's it called? A card house. No, did you? Played $1, $2 blinds. High stakes. Bought him for $500. He bought him for $300. What does that mean? I bought him for $500. Oh, you bought him for $500 and $300. Yeah, I bought him for $500. He bought him for $300. He left with $700 and I left with What? Really? Really? You guys are totally staying until Thursday. Making so much money on this trip. You're like, oh, we're going to be. Look at the suckers sitting down."

You can see some wind behind me, kind of blowing through here. 50-mile-an-hour winds expected tomorrow here in West Texas, so they've decided to push the delay back. Let me do that again. Hold on. Let me, uh... All right. Hey, everybody. Wanted to let you know that the big launch scheduled for tomorrow, Tuesday, has been delayed due to high winds. When's the new launch day? Thursday. So tomorrow, they've delayed the flight. They've scrubbed the flight because of really... Yeah, thanks guys. All right. Hey everybody, want to let you know that tomorrow's big launch has been delayed until Thursday. I know it's disappointing. You can probably see the disappointment in my face, trying to stay positive. Been training over the last three or four days, getting ready for a launch tomorrow, but they delayed it. You can see the wind kind of blowing through my shirt here. 50 mile an hour winds expected tomorrow, so Thursday morning is the launch day and hope that you guys will be with me. Follow the launch at BlueOrigin.com. "

You should really see, you should see their stuff. It's intense. Great. We're ready. Jim, if you want to give your whole spiel, man, it's your time. No, no, no, no. What am I doing? You can't hold the apple. You can hold it, because we're being funny now. No, she's, like, like, Jim. Oh, he wants you to do it. He wants you to interview me. Jim, yeah. You're going to get in. Please, you don't have to be in line. We're just going to be... You can just yell it. I won't frame you. And the question is, how do you feel about going to space? Are you nervous? I just, I've forgotten the question three times. Okay, she's gonna ask you, and you're gonna say it, and then you're gonna do the whole 10-9-8, that thing. No, I'm gonna step out. I'm gonna step out, and it's like... Yep. Blue control, ready for launch. When you're doing that, Mikey's got the shot, okay? You can do it in the same spot. At the end of him doing his countdown, y'all can actually light the rocket for real. Okay, ready? Yeah, go ahead. Jim, how do you feel about going to space? I've been training for this my whole life. Do your spiel. Do your spiel. OK, now we're going to do 10, 9. 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5. Hold. Five. Hold. Four. Hold. Three. Two. Engines ignite. Go! I'm not back yet. You've got to shoot it. Where is it? Where is it? Where is it? You've got to get it. Where is it? Where is it? Hold on, hold on. You got it launching? Hold on, hold on. All right, ready? That was great, man. That was so good. All right, we'll cut that again somehow. We'll make it work. We'll make that work. Oh, wow. Mikey got a really good shot. That looks awesome. And 120. So it actually kind of looks good. We'll zoom in. We can scale it even more. You could trick the viewer for a minute. There you go. And I got a launch. That's great. Straight up. Good job, Sarah. Stay hydrated. Stay hydrated. That was so good. That was good. That was good. Are we doing crew? Oh, Katie. Oh, crew recovery. We can just go throw it in the... Crew recovery. Yeah. Do it. I've got an extra one we can throw in here. You don't want the dingoes. Just throw it right next to that cactus. Or just show it on the ground. Show it on the ground like that, and then we'll show it on the ground like right here. And then I'll be like, and then I'm like, yeah baby that was awesome. Have it in the tree, hang it in the tree. You could even put on screen, like, real audio from inside capsule. Oh, I like that. And then you pick it up. Yeah, it'd be like... How's the rocket launching going? So good. We got a great... In the cactus, here. Here, now, I got this. Oh, wow, it's just soft. Hold on, hold on. Ouch! Ouch! Oh, can't... It's okay. We can, it's just... Wait, I got you. Oh, it's... These aren't reusable, are they? No. Okay. Okay, here, we're gonna put this right here, you set that down, next to the cactus, next to the cactus. Which is right there. Here, yeah, here. Oh, here. Yeah, here, I got this, I got it, I'm the stage. Right here. I got it. But the crew capsule wouldn't be on the booster. Oh, you're right. Well, people wouldn't know that. Some shenanigans. Okay you guys got that? So Susan got a really cool simulation. Did she? Did she do okay? Did she roll into her seat okay? She rolled into her seat okay. She ingressed and egressed well. She didn't necessarily zero-g, but I think the girls had a zero-g plan. Didn't necessarily zero-g. Not yet. Not yet. I like that hanging. See that's what Tuesday's launch would have been. That's hanging from Carlsbad Caverns. No, it actually would have landed on a hillside over there. Really? This has been a two-state event? I mean, I'm exaggerating, but two-state event. Like, maybe Lubbock. Maybe Lubbock. Maybe Lubbock. Dallas. Dallas. Yeah. We would have landed in Texas and been dragged to New Mexico or something like that? No, no, wrong direction. Oh, OK. Yeah. The other way. Like, northwest. Yeah, you'd have gone to, like, Midland. I did Google. You know how you're never supposed to go into WMD when you have back pain? Back pain is caused by cancer, you know? never Google launch rocket and high winds because it says the worst thing that could happen is drogue parachutes deploy and you could get dragged along the savanna or whatever. The only time I've ever used WebMD, this is a true story, Mary and I were on vacation and we were up, I took a month off of work Hello, come be part of our party. We drove the entire PCH. We're almost done. We're out in the Pacific Northwest. Meet these guys, please. Please meet these guys. Oh, no. And so And I wake up at like 6 in the morning like I try to go to the bathroom like, you know, it's like Yeah, like reading bad and I wasn't vomiting like like nothing was really I And so I'm like, I get out the iPad and I'm like on WebMD and I'm like putting in my symptoms and it's like, you have appendicitis. And I'm like, Mary, I have appendicitis. She's like, you do not have appendicitis. You have bad gas. You need to put a man up, walk down the hallway. Come back and get into bed. You've been kept me up all night long Reading me the riot act like you're rooting my vacation And I'm like like I'm in so much pain She's like I don't like you've kept me up all night long so I get do what I do I'm told get out of bed like I go Walk out the door and I've never experienced before but I had that blinding white light pain I could not see I come back in I'm like There's something really wrong here.

                "Transcription": "Oh my god. Hey, I'm Jim Kitchen, and my nuts are frozen. Great. Awesome. We got it. Okay. I'm gonna have to keep this on. All right, Jim, tell us what you did yesterday. Tell us, first of all, what day it is today, including the day and the launch day. And then we'll begin with your recap of what you did yesterday. It's L-2. It's getting real. So this is the schedule for today. And then I'll tell you about what we did yesterday. We got breakfast. Filming the triad, the highlight of my day. It's freezing out here by the airstream, but we're good. Got some shaking off the fatigue because it's been a couple of sleepless nights powering through that. Got some astronaut food to wake me up. That's breakfast. And training begins at eight. basically goes from 8 to 5. And then the Carolina game. Yeah. Triad's really important, but the Carolina game is big. So that's 0 minus 2. Yesterday was the first day of training. So they introduced us to the capsule and they told us, they took us through every scenario. Showed us really from the beginning, showed us from the beginning of launch what the capsule is gonna do. So it rests on the rocket and then it, we have maximum dynamic pressure And then the capsule separates from the launch vehicle. And then we basically float in space for about three and a half minutes. And then we basically go down and we hit 5Gs as we re-enter the atmosphere. And then we float down. The sounds of all of that are intense. So you're sitting on the launch pad and you hear all of these gases. So we're inside this simulated capsule, same size, and you hear all these sounds and they're absolutely deafening. So you have ear buds in there, custom ear buds, to dampen the noise. And when you take off, the inside of the capsule lights orange to simulate the flames coming out of the bottom of the rocket. So they're like, OK, that's fine. That's normal. And then they, when the rocket and the capsule separate, it's just deafening. And what's sobering is there's, for all of this to go perfectly, So many things just have to work correctly. So, you know, you hear about training and you're like, oh, you know, okay, you got to learn how to put my seatbelt on. No, it's being aware of all of the things that could go wrong. And so when I said this morning that it's real, it's because of yesterday. Because, you know, maybe all of these things go right, maybe they don't, and you got to kind of be ready for it. And it's real. So they've only done 20 of these launches. This will be the 20th launch. And, you know, it's very sobering. So today we do it again and again and again and again. We will probably do somewhere between 10 to 15 simulated launches so that on launch day we know everything, what to expect. We know All of the noises, we know how to put our, it's a five point seatbelt. So you got to learn how to get it on. And then when you get into zero gravity, up at around 325,000 feet, which is 10 times as high as we're an airplane flies. You got to be able to get back in to that seat belt in zero g. So you got to learn how to do that. And it's not as easy as just like snap. There's you know. pulling and prodding and getting, you know, sometimes it's wrong. And anyway, you gotta learn how to do all that. And there's a quiz at the end of the day. So you gotta, you gotta, I've been taking copious notes. So it's mentally taxing, but it's so much fun. So if I'm coming off as like, oh, this is a lot and woe is me. Oh my God. This is so much fun. Okay. I'm tired. You can probably see it in my eyes this morning. Um, but oh man, this is, this is the dream of a lifetime. So. That's so pretty out there. I know it's too bad, but we're not Did they tell me five minutes? Did they tell you five minutes? Oh, was I needed? Okay. I just want to ask him about the real, when did you realize yesterday in the training it was real? Yeah, and then a little bit more about like expectations for today. Yeah, those two things. Yeah, but remind me so. All right, Jim, you talked about it getting real after yesterday, but what was the moment during yesterday when you really realized it? What was the first time you were like, oh wow, this isn't a joke, this isn't an easy little training. I think it was just understanding that, well, first of all, I was getting in the capsule for the first time. I was like, oh, this is so much fun. Look, there's my seat. And then being strapped in and hearing the noises, and combined with the videos that we saw, and hearing all of the, contingencies of, all right, if this doesn't work, then the rocket booster or the capsule will do this. And like one of the things is if there's a multiple thing, multiplicity of things that can go wrong, and if they do, you better be strapped in and your head better be against the headrest because this capsule can literally eject from the rocket booster and go 23 g's like independently so it has a rocket engine in the middle of the capsule and it can go off at any second and if you're standing or just goofing around and your head's like over here you may not, you know, you won't survive that. So, you know, watching that, getting your seat belt adjusted properly, you know, you sit in an airplane, it's like, seat belt, ah, you know, this is, it's for real, it's legit, because we're going to be going 2,300 miles an hour. Today is going through all of the launch sequence from A to Z. multiple times so that on launch day, it's routine. It's like, I know what that noise is. I know what I'm doing. I know what my launch plan is. You know, what I'm going to be doing. My seatbelt is configured properly. A big thing today is coming up with what's called a zero G plan. what the crew is going to do, kind of combined, and what I'm going to do in my three and a half minutes of zero-g. "
